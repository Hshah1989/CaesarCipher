# CaesarCipher

This Cipher program is called Caesar Cipher which is an ancient type of encryption. The story goes when Caesar wanted to send highly senstitive military messages, he would encode his messages so the letters would be shifted to encrypt the message. You type the message, you tell the CPU how much you want to shift the message, and the computer will output the encoded result. The program will also let you decode the message. 
This will incorporate functions/inputs and arguments with parameters.
